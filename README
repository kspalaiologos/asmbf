The only true brainfuck assembler. Produces small and efficient brainfuck code based on instruction choice.
With C preprocessor wired up, named labels and all the features you'd expect from a normal assembly, it's ready
for your use. The standard library is currently being constructed and you may contribute to make it even better.
Floating point support is being planned and worked on. Please refer to doc/ for detailed documentation.

https://esolangs.org/wiki/Asm2bf - in-depth explanation of asm2bf inner workings and programming techniques.
                                   serves as a documentation aswell.

test/                            - unit tests for the entire toolchain.

asm2bf was used to create a JSON formatter webservice:
https://github.com/kspalaiologos/JSONFormatter/blob/master/jsonformatter.asm

also, a subleq interpreter approach has been taken:

------------------------------------------ Get a taste of it! ------------------------------------------

#function bf_while(reg) print("nav " .. reg); print("raw .["); end
#function bf_wend(reg) print("nav " .. reg); print("raw .["); end

; branchless* bitness test.
; r1 <= interpreter's bitness
; r2 <= trashed
@bitness
	clr r1
	mov r2, 1
$(bf_while("r2"))
	inc r1
	asl r2
$(bf_wend("r2"))
	ret

; Note: We say branchless, because there are no explicit jumps.
;       There is a branch (a brainfuck loop), but it's not in a
;       logical sense (no label is made, no jmp is executed).
