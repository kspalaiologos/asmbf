The only true brainfuck assembler. Produces small and efficient brainfuck code based on instruction choice.
With Lua preprocessor wired up, named labels and all the features you'd expect from a normal assembly, it's ready
for your use. Precise floating point library is on the board, memory allocation procedures are available for
inlining. Last changes include stack-based offsets, virtual instructions and effective adresses. Why not
check it out?

https://esolangs.org/wiki/Asm2bf - in-depth explanation of asm2bf inner workings and programming techniques.
                                   serves as a documentation aswell. article.txt contains a mirror of this article.
                                   it is a bit outdated (check section "State-of-art Documentation"), but it may
                                   prove itself useful.
examples/                        - who doesn't love learning by examples?
test/                            - unit tests for the entire toolchain.

asm2bf was used to create a JSON formatter webservice:
https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk/JSONFormatter/blob/master/jsonformatter.asm

also, a subleq interpreter approach has been taken:
https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk/SqEMU/blob/master/dev-sqemu.s

------------------------------------------ Get a taste of it! ------------------------------------------

#function bf_while(reg) print("nav " .. reg); print("raw .["); end
#function bf_wend(reg) print("nav " .. reg); print("raw .]"); end

; branchless* bitness test.
; r1 <= interpreter's bitness
; r2 <= trashed
@bitness
	clr r1
	mov r2, 1
$(bf_while("r2"))
	inc r1
	asl r2
$(bf_wend("r2"))
	ret

; Note: We say branchless, because there are no explicit jumps.
;       There is a branch (a brainfuck loop), but it's not in a
;       logical sense (no label is made, no jmp is executed).

--------------------------------------- Installation Instruction ---------------------------------------

1. Pull the repository from github: `git clone https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk/asmbf'
2. Build asm2bf: `make all'
3. Drop asm2bf into your home directory: `make setup'
4. Optional: Add `~/.asmbf' into your PATH.

-------------------------------------- State-of-art Documentation --------------------------------------

There is the esolang wiki article which you can check out, but it's a bit outdated and incomplete.
